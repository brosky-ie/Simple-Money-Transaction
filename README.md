# Basic ATM Transaction Program in Java   

This is a basic ATM program written in Java.   

To run the program, use a Java IDE or the command line.  

If you have the compiled `.class` file:  

1. Open the terminal in VS Code and go to the folder where the `.class` file is saved.    
2. Run the program by typing `java PorkMenudo` (or your class name) and pressing Enter.  

If you want to make changes, use the source code file (`.java`):  

- Rename the file to match the class name (the word after `public class`).    
- Compile the `.java` file with `javac PorkMenudo.java` in the VS Code terminal.    
- Then run the compiled program as stated above.
