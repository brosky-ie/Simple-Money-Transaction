# Basic ATM Transaction Program in Java  

This is a basic ATM program written in Java.  

To run the program, use a Java IDE or the command line.

If you change the class name (the word after `public class`), make sure the file name matches.

In VS Code:
1. Open the terminal and go to the folder where your `.class` file is saved. 
2. Run the program by typing `java PorkMenudo` (or your class name) and pressing Enter.
